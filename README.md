# Pokedex Project

# Creator: Jiaqi Zhu

# Project Objective
By using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co), I aim to design and develop a Pokedex web application that will display a gallery of Pokemon with images. Users are able to choose to load more Pokemon, view details about a specific Pokemon, and mark Pokemon as "caught".
